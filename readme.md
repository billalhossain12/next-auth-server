# Sport Facility Booking System

## Overview

The Sport Facility Booking System is a TypeScript-based backend application designed to manage bookings for various sports facilities. It uses MongoDB for data storage, Mongoose for object modeling, Express.js for handling routes and middleware, and Zod for input validation. The system includes role-based authentication with endpoints accessible to "user" and "admin" roles as per specified permissions.

## Key Features

- **User Management:** Allows users to sign up and log in securely.

- **Facility Management:** Admins can perform CRUD operations on facilities.

- **Booking Management:** Users can book facilities for specific time slots, and admins can view all bookings or bookings by specific users.

- **Availability Check:** Provides endpoint to check availability of facilities on a given date.

- **Role-based Access Control:** Ensures that only authorized users can access specific endpoints based on their roles.
